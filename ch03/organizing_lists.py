# Organizing a list:
# Sorting lists alphabetically and permanently using sort() method
# Sorting lists in reverse-alphabetical order and permanently
# by passing the reverse = True argument in sort(reverse=True) method
# Sorting lists temporarily using sorted() method, the original list does not change
# Sorted(cars, reverse=True) displays in reverse alphabetical order and temporarily
# Printing a list in reverse order permanently, i.e. to reverse the original order of a list
# Using reverse() method (not in alphabetical order)
# apply reverse() method a second time to revert back to the original order in the list from the reversed order in the list
# len(list) displays the length of the list
