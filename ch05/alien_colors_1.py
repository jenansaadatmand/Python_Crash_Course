# Alien colors # 1: Imagine an alien was just hot down in a game
# Create a variable called alien_color and 
# Assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'
# Write an if statement to test whether the alien's color is green
# If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points
# Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails
# (The version that fails will have no output.)

# Passing version
alien_color = 'green' 
if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")

# Failing version that fails the test will have no output
alien_color = 'red'
if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
