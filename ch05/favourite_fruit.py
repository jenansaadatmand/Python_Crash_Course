# Favourite fruit: Make a list of your favourite fruits
# And then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list
# Make a list of your three favourite fruits and call it favourite_fruits
# Write five if statements 
# Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list
# If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement such as You really like bananas!
