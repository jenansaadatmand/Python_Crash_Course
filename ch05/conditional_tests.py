# Conditional tests: write a series of conditional tests
# Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
# Your code should look something like this:

#car = 'subaru'
#print("Is car == 'subaru' ? I predict True.")
#print(car == 'subaru')
#print("\nIs car == 'audio' ? I predict False.")
#print(car == 'audi')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False
# Create at least ten tests. 
# Have at least five tests evaluate to True and another five tests evaluate to False
