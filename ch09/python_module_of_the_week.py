# Exercise 9-16 Python Module of the Week:
# One excellent resource for exploring the Python standard library is a site called Python Module of the Week. 
# Go to https://pymotw.com/ and look at the table of contents.
# Find a module that looks interesting to you and read about it,
# Perhaps starting with the random module


# random module provides a fast pseudorandom number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. Originally developed to produce inputs for Monte Carlo simulations, Mersenne Twister generates numbers with nearly uniform distribution and a large period, making it suited for a wide range of applications.
# math module: contains fast implementations of advanced mathematical functions. NumPy expands the set of functions supported to include linear algebra and Fourier transform functions. It also includes a fast multi-dimensional array implementation, improving the version in the array.
# built-in http.server package includes base classes for creating simple HTTP servers from scratch. It does not offer much support beyond that for building web-based applications, though. The Django and Pyramid packages are two popular web application frameworks that provide more support for advanced features like request parsing, URL routing, and cookie handling.
# API for imaplib is relatively low-level, requiring the caller to understand the IMAP protocol to build queries and parse results. The imapclient package provides a higher-level API that is easier to work with for building applications that need to manipulate IMAP mailboxes.
# time and datetime modules provide functions and classes for manipulating time and date values. Both include functions for parsing strings to turn them into internal representations. The dateutil package includes a more flexible parser that makes it easier to build robust applications that are more forgiving of different input formats.
# datetime module includes a timezone-aware class for representing a specific time on a specific day. It does not, however, include a full timezone database. The pytz package does provide such a database. It is distributed separately from the standard library because it is maintained by other authors and it is updated frequently when timezone and daylight savings time values are changed by the political institutions that control them.
