# list comprehension of squares.py used instead of long code multistep code using range() and for loop and append method to make list numbers  
# List comprehension in one line of code, it combines for loop and the creation of new elements into one line and automatically appends each new element
# Square numbers are presented as value ** 2

squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]
print(squares)
print("\n")
