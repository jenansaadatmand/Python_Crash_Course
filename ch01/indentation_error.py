# Exercise 1-2. Hello World Typos: Unexpected indentation error
# Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. 
# Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

# Answer:
# I choose to introduce an indentation error:

message = ("Hello World !")
    print(message)
