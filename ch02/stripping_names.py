# Exercise 2-7: Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace
# Characters at the beginning and end of the name.  
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once
# Print the name once so the whitespace 
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, 
# lstrip(), rstrip(), strip()

name = "\tjimmy\n\t "
print(name)
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())
