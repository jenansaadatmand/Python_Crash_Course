# Exercise 2-9: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# Operations that result in the number 8.
# Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the results
# You should create four lines that look like this: print(5+3)
# Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on each line
