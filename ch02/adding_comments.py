# Exercise 2-11: adding comments Choose two of the programs you've written, 
# And add at least one comment to each. 
# If you don't have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple
# At this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
# Then write one sentence describing what the program does.  

# Answer 1: 
# This is a comment and all the above are a comment


# Answer 2:
print("Hello World!.") # Print call with an argument to print on the screen, this is an inline comment
