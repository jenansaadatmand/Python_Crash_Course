# While loop runs as long as, or while a certain condition is true
# The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the collection.
# Use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers
# Program of while loop counts from 1 to 5

current_number = 1 # assigning a variable to 1 to start counting
while current_number <=5: # set while loop to keep running as long as the value of current_number is less than or equal to 5
    print(current_number) # prints the value in the variable 
    current_number += 1 # increment/add by 1 each time you go through the loop
# += operator is shorthand for current_number = current_number + 1.
# Python repeats the loop as long as the condition current_number <= 5 is true.
# Once the value of current_number is greater than 5, the loop stops running and the program ends
